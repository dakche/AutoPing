<h3>The <i>best</i> AI powered tool to maximize the staffing efficiency of small businesses.</h3>

  Picture this: The customer foot traffic in your small restaurant business is wildly unpredictable. <br><br>
  Sometimes, you might be understaffed to the point where employees are collapsing due to exhaustion. <br>
  Other times, you might have too many cooks in the kitchen and not enough things to do. <br>
  As the owner, you don't want your employees walking out due to overwork nor do you want to pay for staff that really don't need
  to be there. <br><br>
  So what do you do?<br><br>

<h2>Introducing AutoPing</h2><br>
<p>
  AutoPing constantly monitors the business environment by listening to the ambient noise and uses this information to predict current business conditions. 
  When it infers that there will be a sudden spike in workload in the near future, it will automatically send messages to notify employees on standby to come 
  and help manage the workload, maximizing efficiency for both the workers and the owners, 
  and most of all, saves everyone time and money.<br><br>
